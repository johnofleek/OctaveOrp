# Octave ORP - Arduino AVR

This is a work in progress - the original intention was to complete this
 in C++ but a wider requirement to target microchip PIC (no C++ support)
 has lead to the development of the C project.  

As the C project progresses I will test it with the Arduino mega2560  

Have a look at the Arduino folder for information  

# Octave ORP - C
This sub project targets microcontrollers with limited resources.  
At the moment it is in the API definition phase.  

Have a look at the c folder for information 

# Octave Orp Python Demo
The purpose of this app is to demonstrate and simulate an external 
 computer sending sensor data via a serial port (UART) to the Octave 
 system

The app was tested on a Windows 10 PC and used a mangOH Yellow / WP7702 
 board as the edge device
 
Python demo runs on serial port connected remote machine

# current demo
Is emulateSystem.py

```
python emulateSystem.py
```
 
or 

```
emSysPybv.py
```

# Physical connection
See the docs folder


# Install 

## Clone this repo

```
git clone https://github.com/johnofleek/OctaveOrpPythonDemo
```

## Python3 version
This is working on a PC - it was developed to investigate the possibility of deploying on micropython. So far this isn't working due to data fragmentation issues


## (Python 2 version) Install Python 2.7
```
https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/
```

## Install app dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Edit run.py 
Work out which serial port the USB adapter is and edit this line
 (COM8) to suit
```
DEV = os.getenv('DEV', 'COM8')
```

## Run the app from the remote computers (PC)command line

```
python run.py
```

Or what ever version of app you are using

The current app creates the sensor in the Octave system and sends
 one value



## View the running application data flow

The External Python test app is now transacting serial data with
the Octave system 

On the remote computer command line (PC running Python app) the data looks like this

```

# Further Info

Shouldn't be needed by EPAS

## Octave register device (not reqd EPAS I've done it)

### Config mangOH yellow
Set the switches and connect the internal antenna

* Connect external LTE antenna to MAIN connector  
* Enable external LTE antenna  SW403-5 to ON
* MAIN power switch ON


For Windows host machines Load Sierra driver for WP7702 from https://source.sierrawireless.com/

Power MangOH yellow via USB socket in narrow side of the board

Over AT command port use ati command to retrieve FSN and IMEI

Go to the octave 
https://octave.sierrawireless.io/

Add the device

ssh into the mangOH
After a while attempt a data connection - this seems to speed up the
 provisioning process

```
cm data connect
``` 

This most likely will fail but the Octave web UI probably now indicates
 a provisioned device

## actual image used for demo

Why? - because the default doesn't support ORP 

Image is 
```
module-2.1.0.wp77xx.spk
```

Programming use windows powershell with this 

```
ls

The ORP app causes a Legato restart the first time ever - there is a delay while the backend syncs - after that it works
