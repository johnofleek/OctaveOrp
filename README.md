# Octave ORP 
The purpose of the repository is to provide resources for remote
 devices connected to Sierra Wireless Octave ORP enabled hardware such as
* mangOH yellow
* FX30S WP7702
* WP7702

The *C version* was developed to support limited resource remote microcontrollers  
  devices such as Microchip AVR and PIC.   

The *Python* remote device folders are present for 2 reasons - 
please note that it is not currently being maintained.
It's probable that Sierra Wireless will update their version over time.
1. Python 2.7 to provided an easy way to access the source 
1. Python 3.x was need for a demo and is based on the 2.7 version

The *JavaScript* folder ./edgeJavaScript (at the time of writing) contains
 some Octave edge device JavaScript.
This may continue if it proves useful. This is executed on the Sierra Wireless edge
 device not the remote microcontroller / device.
 
Anyone interested in the development, support, use ... of this open
 source project please get in contact.

# Octave ORP - C
This is a work in progress. This project targets microcontrollers
 with limited resources.  

The original intention was to complete this
 in C++ but a wider requirement to target microchip PIC (no C++ support)
 has lead to the development of the C project.  

The C project is now working with Arduino AVR mega and PIC microcontrollers.  

Have a look at the C folder for more information and examples of Arduino
 and mingw builds.
 
There is some api documentation in the docs/doxy folder
 
The C project is now working with Arduino AVR mega   

Have a look at the C folder for information  

## Octave ORP - PIC 16

The C code can be built and functions on a PIC 16

## Octave ORP - mingw

The C code can be built using mingw gcc


# Octave Orp - Python version
The purpose of this app is to demonstrate and simulate an external 
 computer sending sensor data via a serial port (UART) to the Octave 
 system.  
 
The Python 2.7 code was taken from Sierra Wireless Octave ORP resources.  
The Python 3.x code is based on the 2.7 version but runs on Python 2.7.  

An attempt was made to port the code to micro Python but it was  
 found that a complete rewrite would be needed.

The app was tested on a Windows 10 PC and used a mangOH Yellow / WP7702 
 board as the edge device
 
Python demo runs on serial port connected remote machine

## Python demos
Is emulateSystem.py

```
python emulateSystem.py
```
 
or 

```
emSysPybv.py
```

# Physical / Hardware connections
See the docs folder


# Install 

## Clone this repo

```
git clone https://github.com/johnofleek/OctaveOrpPythonDemo
```

## Python3 version
This is working on a PC - it was developed to investigate the possibility of deploying on micropython. So far this isn't working due to data fragmentation issues


## (Python 2 version) Install Python 2.7
```
https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/
```

## Install app dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Edit run.py 
Work out which serial port the USB adapter is and edit this line
 (COM8) to suit
```
DEV = os.getenv('DEV', 'COM8')
```

## Run the app from the remote computers (PC)command line

```
python run.py
```

Or what ever version of app you are using

The current app creates the sensor in the Octave system and sends
 one value



## View the running application data flow

The External Python test app is now transacting serial data with
the Octave system 

On the remote computer command line (PC running Python app) the data looks like this

```

# Further Info


## Octave register device

### Config mangOH yellow
Set the switches and connect the internal antenna

* Connect external LTE antenna to MAIN connector  
* Enable external LTE antenna  SW403-5 to ON
* MAIN power switch ON


For Windows host machines Load Sierra driver for WP7702 from https://source.sierrawireless.com/

Power MangOH yellow via USB socket in narrow side of the board

Over AT command port use ati command to retrieve FSN and IMEI

Go to the octave 
https://octave.sierrawireless.io/

Add the device

ssh into the mangOH
After a while attempt a data connection - this seems to speed up the
 provisioning process

```
cm data connect
``` 

This most likely will fail but the Octave web UI probably now indicates
 a provisioned device
