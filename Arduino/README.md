# Arduino ORP demo
This Arduino application reads temperature from a thermistor and sends the temperature value to the Octave cloud.  

## Hardware
This is a list of the hardware used to test the application.  

* Arduino Mega 2560
* mangOH yellow WP7702 with Octave build Version 2.1.0 (octave_2.1.3_wp77xx Legato version 19.07 Modem firmware version R12)
* SEEED Grove - Temperature Sensor V1.2 attached to Arduino ADC 0
