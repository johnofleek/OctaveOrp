## Cost model 2020-02
Octave monthly charge is $1  
* message costs $0.001
* message can hold up to 20 data points
* data point can hold up to 25 Characters

Message cost examples - it costs  
* $0.001 to send 20 data points x 25 bytes  = 500 bytes of data  = 1 message
* $0.001 to send 1 byte of data (1 message)

The only charges are the  
* Messages  $0.001 per message - Octave data transactions between the WP7702 and the Octave Cloud
* Monthly charge of $1 - includes the Octave cloud, Cloud API, the airtime , SIM, Edge Octave applications ...

$0.002 per KB
$2 Mbyte

10Kbytes * 1000 a day = 10 Mbytes / day


## Octave Edge compute

The local edge data and edge compute is not charged for as it never leaves the WP7702.

 I think this might present an opportunity for this project as it is basically uncommitted compute power that costs nothing to run, can be updated from the cloud, and can be rewritten to suite the application at any time, even post shipment. The only cost is the message to deliver the code from the cloud to the
